# push-stream

This is documented [here](https://github.com/pushaas/pushaas-docs#component-push-stream).

This is a simple Docker image of https://github.com/wandenberg/nginx-push-stream-module.

The image was built with a very basic Nginx configuration that you should not use in production. You should restrict the publishing interface to only trusted addresses.
